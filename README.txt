Sophia Fondell - Eight Puzzle Project

This is a final project I did for CS 111 - Intro to Computer Science I, in which I and a partner had to create classes for the board, the state of the board, and a searcher to find the board solution using different types of searches such as Depth first and Breadth first search. I also wrote a class to test all of this code.
